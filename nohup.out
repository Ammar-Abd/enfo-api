You have loaded plyr after dplyr - this is likely to cause problems.
If you need functions from both plyr and dplyr, please load plyr first, then dplyr:
library(plyr); library(dplyr)

# Use stats::lag() to make sure you're not using dplyr::lag(), or you can add #
# conflictRules('dplyr', exclude = 'lag') to your .Rprofile to stop           #
